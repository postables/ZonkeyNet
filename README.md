<a href="http://localhost:8080" target="_blank" title="ZonkeyNet Mesh Network"><b>ZonkeyNet</b></a> (based on <b>Airchat</b> coded by <b>LulzSec</b>) is a <b>Free Speech</b> digital communications protocol that doesn’t deal with expensive, 
                highly-surveilled commercial and government controlled infrastructure.
<b>Create a mesh network</b>" between other ZonkeyNet users running the same software.</b>

                Each node in this mesh network is defined by it’s ability to decrypt messages.
                There’s no hardware ID, and no plain text transmitter identification.
